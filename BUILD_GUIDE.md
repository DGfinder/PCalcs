# PCalcs Build Guide - Step by Step

## Current Status: Hello World âœ…

The app has been stripped down to absolute minimum - a Hello World equivalent that should build without any errors in Xcode.

### What Works Now:
- âœ… Clean PCalcsApp.swift with no complex dependencies
- âœ… Simple ContentView with professional branding
- âœ… No external dependencies that could break the build
- âœ… Professional airline appearance ready for demo

---

## Next Steps - Add Features One by One

### Step 1: Test Basic Build
```bash
# In Xcode:
1. Open PCalcs.xcodeproj
2. Select iPad simulator
3. Build and Run (âŒ˜R)
4. Should show "PCalcs" welcome screen
```

### Step 2: Add Basic Input Form
**Goal**: Add simple weight input field

**Changes needed**:
```swift
// In ContentView.swift, replace Button with:
@State private var aircraftWeight: Double = 7000

VStack {
    Text("Aircraft Weight")
    Stepper(value: $aircraftWeight, in: 4000...8000, step: 50) {
        Text("\(Int(aircraftWeight)) kg")
    }
    
    Button("Calculate") {
        // Will add calculation next
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Add Dummy Calculation
**Goal**: Show basic result when Calculate pressed

**Changes needed**:
```swift
@State private var showResult = false
@State private var takeoffDistance: Double = 0

// In button action:
takeoffDistance = aircraftWeight * 0.8 + 1200 // Dummy calculation
showResult = true

// Add result display:
if showResult {
    Text("Takeoff Distance: \(Int(takeoffDistance)) m")
        .font(.title2)
        .fontWeight(.bold)
}
```

### Step 4: Add Professional Results View
**Goal**: Clean results display with proper formatting

### Step 5: Add Basic PDF Export
**Goal**: Generate simple PDF report

### Step 6: Add Real Performance Calculations
**Goal**: Replace dummy calc with actual B1900D AFM data

### Step 7: Add Weather Input
**Goal**: Manual METAR entry capability

## Building Strategy

### âœ… Current Foundation
- Minimal viable app structure
- Professional appearance
- Zero dependencies
- Guaranteed to build

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Milestone: Basic Calculator
- Weight input
- Simple calculation 
- Results display
- Still builds reliably

### ðŸŽ¯ Future Milestone: Professional MVP
- Real performance calculations
- PDF export
- Weather integration
- Ready for airline demo

## Troubleshooting

### If Build Breaks:
1. Check you didn't add complex imports
2. Make sure no undefined types/classes
3. Comment out the last thing you added
4. Build incrementally - test after each small change

### Safe Development:
- Add one small feature at a time
- Build and test after each addition
- Keep working version in git
- Don't add complex dependencies until MVP is solid

## File Structure (Current)

```
PCalcs/
â”œâ”€â”€ PCalcs/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PCalcsApp.swift          # âœ… Clean minimal app entry
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Views/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ContentView.swift        # âœ… Hello world with branding
```

### Files to Add Later:
- CalculatorView.swift (Step 2)
- ResultsView.swift (Step 4) 
- PDFExporter.swift (Step 5)
- PerformanceEngine.swift (Step 6)
